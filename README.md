# 🔥 Forest Fire Detection Using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based image classification project that detects the presence of forest fires using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Developed as part of a 4-week project-based internship organized by **Edunet Foundation**, **AICTE**, and **Shell**.

Trained and evaluated using the **Kaggle Wildfire Dataset** on Google Colab with a T4 GPU. This project showcases how deep learning can be used for environmental monitoring and real-world problem-solving.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Build an accurate CNN model to classify images as **fire** or **no fire**.
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle Wildfire Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmadafri/the-wildfire-dataset)
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Platform:** Google Colab (NVIDIA T4 GPU)
- **Accuracy Achieved:** ~84% (training) and ~80% (validation)

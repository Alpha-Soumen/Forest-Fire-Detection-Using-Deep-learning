# Forest-Fire-Detection-Using-Deep-learning
A deep learning-based solution for early detection of forest fires using image classification techniques. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately identify fire-affected regions from real-time or pre-captured forest surveillance images. Aimed at minimizing response time and reducing wildfire impact.
